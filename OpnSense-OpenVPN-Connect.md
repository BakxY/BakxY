# Issue with setup for openvpn connect and opnsense openvpn server

## Issue

The dowloaded files from the opnsense openvpn server didn't work with the openvpn connect software. When connection, it gave an error: "OpenSSLContextError. CA not defined".

## Solution

Export the user config as "File only". This format is compatible with openvpn connect.
