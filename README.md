Hi, thereðŸ‘‹

I'm Severin, an 20-Year-old electronics engineer. I live in Frauenfeld in the small county of SwitzerlandðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­. I started my coding journey working with Arduino at the age of 12. After some years I started to learn other languages like C for desktop development and also started using C for all of my embedded project with minimal frameworks. During my study, I learned to use other languages such as C#, JavaScript/TypeScript and some other modern programming languages. Since then, I decided that I want to move my career towards the embedded software development part of electronics engineering. I'm currently on my way to get a bachelor in electronics engineering.
Some of my project I post here on GitHub. But most of my side project are uploaded to my private GitLab instance, which I host from the comfort of my home. So if you want to check out some of those project [here](https://git.sespra.ch/BakxY) is the link to my profile.

If you have any questions or just want to chat, hit me up on discord (bakxy) or if it's something formal, write me an email at [severin.sprenger@sespra.ch](mailto:severin.sprenger@sespra.ch).
