Hi, there👋

I'm Severin, an 22-Year-old electronics engineer. I live in Frauenfeld in the small country of Switzerland🇨🇭. I started my coding journey working with Arduino at the age of 12. After some years I started to learn other languages like C for desktop development and also started using C for all of my embedded project with minimal frameworks. During my study, I learned to use other languages such as C#, JavaScript/TypeScript and some other modern programming languages. Since then, I decided that I want to move my career towards the embedded software development part of electronics engineering. I'm currently on my way to get a bachelor in electronics engineering at the ZHAW University of Applied Sciences in Winterthur.
Some of my project I post here on GitHub. But most of my side project are uploaded to my private GitLab instance, which I host from the comfort of my home. So if you want to check out some of those project, [here](https://git.sespra.ch/BakxY) is the link to my profile.
