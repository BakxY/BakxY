Hi, I'm an 19-Year-old electronics engineer in training. 
I live in Frauenfeld in Switzerland, and started working with Arduino at the age of 12. After some years i started to learn other languages like C for desktop development.
I currently use C, C# and Typescript for my projects. My goal is to study cumputer sience after my apprenticeship.
